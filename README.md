File Monitoring System
Hi there! Welcome to the File Monitoring System. This is a Java project I worked on during my time at HCMUS. It does a cool thing where it keeps an eye on folders, and I've added some other neat stuff too!

What It Does
Watching Folders: The program can watch folders that someone else sends to it.
Picking Stuff: I made it so that it can choose a special file or folder inside the folder it's watching.
Telling Me Things: Whenever someone adds, deletes, or changes stuff in the folder, it sends a message to me so I know what's happening.
Watching Lots of People: It can watch lots of different people, but each person can only have one folder watched.
Extra Cool Stuff
Chatty Chats: There's a little chat thing that lets me talk to the program.
Logs Galore: It can save logs in a file called 'log.txt'.
Letting Me Know: If the program or I stop working, it tells the other one.
How to Start
If you're new to this, don't worry! Here's how you can start writing code in Java using Visual Studio Code.

Where Things Are
Inside the project, there are a few folders:

src: This is where the main code lives.
lib: It keeps important stuff the project needs.
bin: When I run the program, it puts the finished stuff here.
Finding What I Need
To manage the things the project depends on, I use something called JAVA PROJECTS. I can add or remove things there to help my project work better.

I hope this helps! If you want more details, there might be some instructions or other info that came with the project. Or you can ask someone who knows more about this stuff!
